simultaneously frontend + backend connectivity


Authentication 
		It is used for securing access to resources and ensuring that users are who they claim to be. 
    Authentication can be implemented in various ways depending on the requirements of the application, 
    such as using usernames and passwords, token-based, o_auth, multi_auth methods etc.

Bcrypt => bcryptjs
It is a popular password hashing library for Node.js applications. 
It provides a secure way to hash and verify passwords, making it difficult for attackers to crack passwords 
even if they gain access to the hashed value 

3 Important Steps:
npm install bcrypt or bcryptjs 
bcrypt.hash(password, 10) -> salt factor 10 rounds  //register
bcrypt.compare(userProvidedPassword, storedHashedPassword) //login
